 ==============================================================================
                       ##### FLASH peripheral features #####
 ==============================================================================

 [\&.\&.] The Flash memory interface manages CPU AHB I-Code and D-Code accesses
      to the Flash memory\&. It implements the erase and program Flash memory operations
      and the read and write protection mechanisms\&.

 [\&.\&.] The Flash memory interface accelerates code execution with a system of instruction
      prefetch and cache lines\&.

 [\&.\&.] The FLASH main features are:
     (+) Flash memory read operations
     (+) Flash memory program/erase operations
     (+) Read / write protections
     (+) Option bytes programming
     (+) Prefetch on I-Code
     (+) 32 cache lines of 4*64 bits on I-Code
     (+) Error code correction (ECC) : Data in flash are 72-bits word
         (8 bits added per double word)

                       ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
   [\&.\&.]
     This driver provides functions and macros to configure and program the FLASH
     memory of all STM32G0xx devices\&.

     (#) Flash Memory IO Programming functions:
          (++) Lock and Unlock the FLASH interface using HAL_FLASH_Unlock() and
               HAL_FLASH_Lock() functions
          (++) Program functions: double word and fast program (full row programming)
          (++) There are two modes of programming:
           (+++) Polling mode using HAL_FLASH_Program() function
           (+++) Interrupt mode using HAL_FLASH_Program_IT() function

     (#) Interrupts and flags management functions:
          (++) Handle FLASH interrupts by calling HAL_FLASH_IRQHandler()
          (++) Callback functions are called when the flash operations are finished :
               HAL_FLASH_EndOfOperationCallback() when everything is ok, otherwise
               HAL_FLASH_OperationErrorCallback()
          (++) Get error flag status by calling HAL_GetError()

     (#) Option bytes management functions :
          (++) Lock and Unlock the option bytes using HAL_FLASH_OB_Unlock() and
               HAL_FLASH_OB_Lock() functions
          (++) Launch the reload of the option bytes using HAL_FLASH_OB_Launch() function\&.
               In this case, a reset is generated

   [\&.\&.]
     In addition to these functions, this driver includes a set of macros allowing
     to handle the following operations:
      (+) Set the latency
      (+) Enable/Disable the prefetch buffer
      (+) Enable/Disable the Instruction cache
      (+) Reset the Instruction cache
      (+) Enable/Disable the Flash power-down during low-power run and sleep modes
      (+) Enable/Disable the Flash interrupts
      (+) Monitor the Flash flags status.fi
