Autors: Kamil Ko≈õnik, Kacper Radzikowski\\ Project description:\\ Main goal of the project is to measure distnace to the objects, on the surface of 180 degrees, which is possible by usage of simple servomotor\&. Measurement is visualized on LCD display\&. All settings can be accesed by UART interface conected to computer COM port\&.
