Autors\+: Kamil Ko≈õnik, Kacper Radzikowski\textbackslash{} Project description\+:\textbackslash{} Main goal of the project is to measure distnace to the objects, on the surface of 180 degrees, which is possible by usage of simple servomotor. Measurement is visualized on LCD display. All settings can be accesed by UART interface conected to computer COM port.

Technical specs\+:\textbackslash{} Microcontroller ARM STM32\+GX, core Cortex M0+\textbackslash{} Ultrasonic distance sensor with range about 2-\/200cm\textbackslash{} Servomotor with movement range 180 degrees, controlled by PWM wave with certain period and fulfillment\textbackslash{} LCD TFT display, resolution 320x240px with SPI interface\textbackslash{} Converter TTL UART-\/\+USB\textbackslash{} Extennal power supply 5V from powerbank
